# Interop
__InterOperabilty__ between `mosdef` and `openff` sofware stacks will be implemented in this repository
with plans to:

1. Develop understanding of `OpenForceField` software stack.
2. Seek a one–to–one mapping between objects in `gmso` and the `openFF` software stack, enhancing the datastructures if needeed, to develop the specification that we initially agreed to.
3. Bring `gmso`esque features to `OpenFF` and vice versa.
